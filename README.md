# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Description
This repository contains implementations of common **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in various programming languages. The goal is to provide efficient solutions to standard problems, along with explanations of how these algorithms work and their time complexities.

## Features
- üìö Implementations of common **Data Structures** such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)
  - Graphs
  - Heaps
  - Hash Tables
- ‚öôÔ∏è Implementations of essential **Algorithms** including:
  - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
  - Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Recursion

## Installation

To clone this repository and start using the code:
